          Since our establishment, IFHR( Innovative Foundation for Health
          Research Foundation) has been working relentlessly to lay the
          foundation for building a strong and cohesive healthcare sector in
          Nepal with a clear vision and ambitious strategy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Through detailed analysis, planning, and effective engagement and
          communication with all key stakeholders, we have already made
          significant progress toward our goals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We advocate the concept that ‘prevention is better than treatment’ and
          this is driving us to provide improved access to our services; one of
          our top priorities. We have also increased the capacity of the
          healthcare delivery system to better serve the population in terms of
          quality – but our work has just begun.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="font-weight: 600">
          Our objectives are based on our values and our commitment to
          fulfilling the needs of society, and will be achieved through the
          implementation of our dedication to accountability, trust, integrity,
          quality, excellence and team spirit.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I would like to thank you for your continuous interest in our journey
          and your support for our humanitarian and community-centric
          initiatives to make Nepal a healthy society, where members of the
          community can continue to prosper. I also urge you to be part of the
          change. You can contribute either by taking preventive measures
          towards your health or participating in our ongoing health and
          well-being programs and initiatives.
